## Development

VS Code is used to develope backend and frontend of the system. Frontend components are developed using React. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and uses [AntDesign](https://ant.design/components/overview/) for frontend react components.

Following Software / Plugins are required to be installed on Development Machcine
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Yarn Package Manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started)
  * Yarn is the package manager to install dependencies from `package.json` and creates `yarn.lock` file. Alternatively, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) could be used, which comes with `node`.

 `yarn run start:dev` 

This will launch the application in your default browser on port `3000`. If this port is busy following prompt will ask you to launch the application using some other free port:

```
 Something is already running on port 3000.

Would you like to run the app on another port instead? (Y/n)
